And what I love most about her, besides her creative skill and amazing communication, is that she won’t stop until I am completely satistfied with all projects. We’ve had some pretty busy times together creating email templates for promotions and campaigns, where regardless of the time change between our countries, she has always been on time with projects - such a thorough and dedicated worker. She is amazing at following instructions, but also really good at throwing in her own creative twists and recommendations, I love working with Kersly!"',
